# nasa-mission-control

Mission Control allows you to schedule an interstellar expedition to one of the Kepler Exoplanets and to view upcoming and previous launches from NASA and SpaceX.

I decided to build Mission Control as my first practice project, after graduating from the Cal Poly Full Stack Bootcamp because although it is a simple user experience, I had to touch on many core concepts of back-end development. Some of those concepts include designing a REST API, reading data from the file system, implementing an API versioning system, utilizing 3rd party APIs, building a NoSQL database, implementing load balancing, and containerization using Docker and an AWS EC2 instance.
